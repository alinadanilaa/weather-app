# Dynamic Weather Website

I have developed a dynamic weather website that provides real-time weather data by fetching information from an online API called OpenWeatherMap.

## Features

- Built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- User-friendly interface for accessing current weather conditions and forecasts.
- Hourly and daily forecast details available.
- UI design inspired by Mayank Chaudhary on Figma.

## Technology Stack

- **React:** Utilized React to build a modular and efficient user interface.
- **Luxon:** Used Luxon, a date and time library, for handling time-related operations and formatting.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Employed Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling, enabling a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **API Integration:** Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
