I have developed a dynamic weather website that provides real-time weather data by fetching information from an online API called Open Weather. This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website offers a user-friendly interface allowing users to access current weather conditions in their desired or current location, as well as hourly and daily forecasts. UI inspired by Mayank Chaudhary on Figma.

Technology Stack:
React: Utilized React to build a modular and efficient user interface.
Luxon: Used Luxon, a date and time library, to handle time-related operations and formatting.
Tailwind CSS: Employed Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling, enabling a clean and maintainable codebase.
API Integration: Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
